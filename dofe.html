            <p>For my King's Scout Award, I completed my Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award. Starting it in 2021, I completed it in 2025. The award consists of five sections: 
                Volunteering, Physical, Skills Expedition and a Residential</p>

              <h2>Volunteering - 12 Months</h2>
              <p>For my volunteering section, I became a young leader in November 2021 at the 5th Blackpool Cubs. My aim was to run activities that would let the cubs earn three badges.
                Linking one the badges to the King's Scout Award, I ran a series of activities that would allow the cubs to earn their Environmental Conservation Badge by discussing
                the environment and how to protect it and making bug hotels and litter picking on our field. I also ran a series of activities that would allow the cubs to earn their 
                Communicator Badge by teaching them how to use a radio and how to communicate with each other. Finally, I ran a series of activities that would allow the cubs to earn their 
                Digital Citizen Badge by teaching them how to use scratch and produce a short animation. Since completeing my required 12 months I have continued to be a part of the leadership at 
                cubs and have become a full leader.

                <h2>Physical - 12 Months</h2>
                <p>For my physical section, I continued with my climbing which I stopped after lockdown. Returning to the National Indoor Climbing Award Scheme (NICAS) and the
                   National Indoor Bouldering Award Scheme (NIBAS) Level 3, my aim was to climb at an average of grade 6A/6A+ and bouldering at an average of V4/V5. I attended 
                   the classes every week and completed my section in December 2022 achieving my goal. After my section I unfortunatley had to stop climbing due to other commitments.

                <h2>Skills - 6 Months</h2>
                <p>for my section, I started marksmanship. Joining the Blackpool Fullbore Pistol and Rifle Club. My aim was to pass the six month probationary period which involved a range saftey test and 
                  regular supervised attendance at the club. I attended every Wednesday evening shooting primarily with a .22LR Semi-Automatic Rifle and a .22LR Bolt Action Rifle. 
                  I completed my section in August 2023, passing my probationary period and becoming a full member of the club. After completing my section I have continued to hold membership and attend the club weekly 
                  developing my skills further and I am looking at taking part in competitions in the future.

                <h2>Expedition - 4 Days 3 Nights</h2>
                <p>I did my expedition in the Lake District, starting at Ennerdale Bridge and ending in Pooley Bridge. Walking on average twenty kilometers a day with at least one large incline a day. 
                  I also had the challenge of wild camping on the third night at Grizdale Tarn in 40mph winds and heavy rain which was more difficult because it was after the third day which we found to 
                  be the most difficult. Our teams aim was to document and track our teams morale throughout the length of the expedition. We did this through short videos and photos which we presented to an audience 
                  after the expedition. We found that our morale was highest at the start of the expedition and lowest on the incline on the third day. At the end of the trip we were at our highest morale 
                  and enjoyed an ice cream at Pooley Bridge. The expedition was challenging but helped better my navigation skills and leading a team.

                <h2>Residential - 9 Days 8 Nights</h2>
                <p>Arguably my favourite part of the whole experience, I attended a nine-day sailing voyage with the Tall Ships Youth Trust. Sailing around the Canary Islands over the 
                  New Year holiday. Starting in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, I boarded the 72-foot yacht and travelled to Gran Canaria, La Gomera, and La Palma, then sailed back to Tenerife. 
                  As this was my first time sailing, I learned how to hoist and stow the sails, steer and moor. I also took part in an overnight sail from La Palma back to Tenerife using 
                  a watch system, which at one point left me steering using the stars. We did a system of one day sailing one day on land which allowed us to explore the islands, 
                  we arrived at La Gomera on New Years Eve and partied into 2025 on the boat toasting to our new friends and crewmates singing songs and a shanty before heading into 
                  the town square where an island party was happening where we joined in with the residents dancing to a local band. While on the boat, I also did my share of 
                  below-deck duties, cleaning and cooking for the crew. At the end of the voyage, I had achieved my Royal Yachting Association Competent Crew Award. 
                  After completing this section, I would definitely consider attending another voyage and look into earning my Watch Leader award.</p>

                  <h2>Celebration at Buckingham Palace</h2>
                  <p>In May 2025, I was invited to a celebration of my award at Buckingham Palace. Here I was able to celebrate with many others across the country at our awards, including, 
                    by pure coincidence, one of my friends whom I met on my sailing voyage. I was able to meet other scouts from across the UK who had also earned their award and took part in 
                    a UK Scouts celebration photo. It was an honour to attend this event, and I only wish I could go again.</p>
